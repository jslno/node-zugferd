Notes:

In many countries, the value of merchandise exported and imported by mail is considerable, but the exporter or importer concerned would be unable to state by which mode postal items had been conveyed.

Method to convey goods and/or persons is by multimodal transport.
Notes:
1) This code is provided for practical reasons, despite the fact that multimodal transport is not a genuine mode of transport. It can be used when goods are carried by at least two different modes from a place at which the goods are taken in charge by a transport operator to a place designated for delivery, on the basis of one transport contract. (Operations of pick-up and delivery of goods carried out in the performance of a single mode of transport, as defined in such a contract, shall not be considered as multimodal transport).
