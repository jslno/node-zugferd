title: Create your first profile
description: In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of creating your first node-zugferd profile.
---

<Callout type="warn">This guide assumes you have [setup the basics](/docs/basic-usage)
of node-zugferd and are ready to create your first profile.</Callout>

<Steps>

<Step>
### Plan your idea

Before beginning, you must know what profile and version you intend to create.

In this guide, we'll create a **demo profile** to showcase the basic profile usage.
</Step>

<Step>
### Profile Configuration

Go ahead and find a suitable location to create an demo plugin folder, with an `index.ts` file within.

<Files>
    <Folder name="demo-profile" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.ts" />
    </Folder>
</Files>

In the `index.ts` file, we'll export a variable with the return of `createProfile` that represents our profile. This will be what we'll later set as profile in our instance inside `invoicer.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { createProfile } from "node-zugferd/profile";

export const demo = createProfile({
    contextParameter:
		"urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#compliant#urn:factur-x.eu:1p0:basic",
	extends: [...BASIC_WL.extends, BASIC_WL],
	xsdPath: "Factur-X_1.07.2_BASIC.xsd",
	conformanceLevel: "BASIC",
	documentFileName: "factur-x.xml",
	documentType: "INVOICE",
	version: "1.0",
});
```

This will throw an type error, as we still have to define our schema.

</Step>

<Step>
### Defining a schema

In order to generate documents from the profile, we must create a schema which is mapping the documents xml structure to an typescript object.
Because the schema, depending on its size, quickly gets unreadable we create it inside a `schema.ts` file, thats exporting the profiles schema.

Our structure should now look something like this:

<Files>
    <Folder name="demo-profile" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.ts" />
        <File name="schema.ts" />
    </Folder>
</Files>

```ts title="schema.ts"
import type { Schema } from "node-zugferd/types";

export const demoSchema = {
    /**
     * Business process type
    */
    businessProcessType: {
		type: "string",
		required: false,
		xpath:
			"/rsm:CrossIndustryInvoice/rsm:ExchangedDocumentContext/ram:BusinessProcessSpecifiedDocumentContextParameter/ram:ID",
	},
    /**
     * Invoice number
    */
    number: {
		type: "string",
		xpath: "/rsm:CrossIndustryInvoice/rsm:ExchangedDocument/ram:ID",
	},

    //...
} satisfies Schema;
```

Now we still have to update the configuration in `index.ts` to use the schema from `schema.ts`:

```ts title="index.ts"
//...
import { demoSchema } from "./schema"; // [!code highlight]

export const demo = createProfile({
    //...
    schema: demoSchema, // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>
