### Issues and Bug Fixes

- Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jslno/node-zugferd/issues) for tasks labeled `good first issue`
- When reporting bugs, include steps to reproduce and expected behavior
- Comment on issues you'd like to work on to avoid duplicate efforts

### Documentation

- Fix typos and errors
- Add examples and clarify existing content
- Ensure documentation is up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

We use Vitest for testing. Place test files next to the source files they test:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("Feature", () => {
  it("should work as expected", async () => {
    // Test code here
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

- Write clear commit messages
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Add tests for new features
- Follow our coding standards
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change
