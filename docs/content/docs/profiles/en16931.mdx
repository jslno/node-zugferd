title: EN16931 (Comfort)
description: Includes BASIC profile with additional EN 16931-compliant data for invoices.
priority: 0.7
---

import { EN16931 } from "node-zugferd/profile/en16931";

This profile includes [BASIC](/docs/profiles/basic), with
all the additional data required by the European Semantics Standard, whether optional or
conditional. It is **fully compliant to EN 16931**, focussing on the core elements of an electronic invoice.

```ts
import { EN16931, type ProfileEN16931 } from "node-zugferd/profile/en16931";
import { COMFORT, type ProfileComfort } from "node-zugferd/profile/comfort";
```

## Basic Usage

<Steps>

<Step>
### Setup the Profile

First configure the zugferd instance (`invoicer`) to use the EN16931 profile.
This defines the standard and complexity level of the invoice.

```ts title="invoicer.ts"
import { EN16931 } from "node-zugferd/profile/en16931"; // [!code highlight]

export const invoicer = zugferd({
  profile: EN16931, // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Define Invoice Data

Now define the actual invoice content, including all required fields of the
profile, using the `ProfileEN16931` type for type safety.

```ts
import { ProfileEN16931 } from "node-zugferd/profile/en16931";

const data: ProfileEN16931 = {
  number: "INV-001",
  // ...
};
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create Invoice

Use the previously created instance (`invoicer`) to generate the invoice from your data. You can either:

- Generate standalone XML
- Embed the XML inside a PDF/A-3b compliant file.

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import { invoicer } from "./invoicer";

const invoice = invoicer.create(data);

// Only generate xml
const xml = await invoice.toXML();

// Or embed xml in a PDF-A/3b
const pdf = fs.readFileSync("./your/invoice.pdf");
const pdfA = await invoicer.embedInPdf(pdf); // [!code highlight]
```

</Step>

<Step>
### ðŸŽ‰ That's it [#thats-it]

Your invoice is now ready! You've successfully created a ZUGFeRD invoice using the EN16931 profile.
