import { MINIMUM } from "node-zugferd/profile/minimum";

This profile contains the minimum of data which must be present in the
structured data file, some of which may depend on the data being actually available, like the
supplier's intra-community VAT identifier number which is mandatory if the supplier has one.

//...
import { MINIMUM } from "node-zugferd/profile/minimum"; // [!code highlight]
