This includes the profile [MINIMUM](/docs/profiles/minimum) plus some
additional data which is typically required for process automation on the buyerâ€™s side. Such data may
be optional or conditional, depending on the underlying business transaction. This profile does not
include any invoice information at line level, but it contains all mandatory fields on document level,
including those on which business rules from the EN 16931 may apply.
