title: Basic WL
description: Includes MINIMUM profile plus additional data for buyer's process automation.
priority: 0.7
---

import { BASIC_WL } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic-wl";

This includes the profile [MINIMUM](/docs/profiles/minimum) plus some
additional data which is typically required for process automation on the buyerâ€™s side. Such data may
be optional or conditional, depending on the underlying business transaction. This profile does not
include any invoice information at line level, but it contains all mandatory fields on document level,
including those on which business rules from the EN 16931 may apply.

```ts
import { BASIC_WL, type ProfileBasicWL } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic-wl";
```

<Callout type="warn">Documents containing only information of the first two profiles (MINIMUM and
BASIC WL) are not considered to be invoices according to German fiscal law ([&#8594;
GoBD](https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/BMF_Schreiben/Weitere_Steuerthemen/Abgabenordnung/2019-11-28-GoBD.html));
they may therefore not be used as electronic invoices in Germany. They will
not be considered as invoices in France anymore once the einvoicing B2B
mandate CTC reform has been fully deployed (2028). **It is then highly
recommended to target the [BASIC](/docs/profiles/basic) profile at minimum.**</Callout>

## Basic Usage

<Steps>

<Step>
### Setup the Profile

First configure the zugferd instance (`invoicer`) to use the Basic WL profile.
This defines the standard and complexity level of the invoice.

```ts title="invoicer.ts"
import { BASIC_WL } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic-wl"; // [!code highlight]

export const invoicer = zugferd({
  profile: BASIC_WL, // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Define Invoice Data

Now define the actual invoice content, including all required fields of the
profile, using the `ProfileBasicWL` type for type safety.

```ts
import { ProfileBasicWL } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic-wl";

const data: ProfileBasicWL = {
  number: "INV-001",
  // ...
};
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create Invoice

Use the previously created instance (`invoicer`) to generate the invoice from your data. You can either:

- Generate standalone XML
- Embed the XML inside a PDF/A-3b compliant file.

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import { invoicer } from "./invoicer";

const invoice = invoicer.create(data);

// Only generate xml
const xml = await invoice.toXML();

// Or embed xml in a PDF-A/3b
const pdf = fs.readFileSync("./your/invoice.pdf");
const pdfA = await invoicer.embedInPdf(pdf); // [!code highlight]
```

</Step>

<Step>
### ðŸŽ‰ That's it [#thats-it]

Your invoice is now ready! You've successfully created a ZUGFeRD invoice using the Basic WL profile.
