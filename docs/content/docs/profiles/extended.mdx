import { EXTENDED } from "node-zugferd/profile/extended";

This profile constitutes an extension of [EN16931 (Comfort)](/docs/profiles/en16931)
aimed at supporting complex business processes (i.e. invoices which are being invoiced across
multiple deliveries or delivery locations, structured terms of payment, further details at item level to
facilitate warehousing etc.), and any business case inventoried in France (gathered in a subset named
EXTENDED B2B FR and its subset EXTENDED-CTC-FR, as referenced by the French Tax Administration
and National Platform PPF â€“ Portail Public de Facturation). This includes additional code lists values
which are not part of the [European Norm EN 16931 code lists](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/Registry+of+supporting+artefacts+to+implement+EN16931).

```ts
import { EXTENDED, type ProfileExtended } from "node-zugferd/profile/extended";
```

## Basic Usage

<Steps>

<Step>
### Setup the Profile

First configure the zugferd instance (`invoicer`) to use the Extended profile.
This defines the standard and complexity level of the invoice.

```ts title="invoicer.ts"
import { EXTENDED } from "node-zugferd/profile/extended"; // [!code highlight]

export const invoicer = zugferd({
  profile: EXTENDED, // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Define Invoice Data

Now define the actual invoice content, including all required fields of the
profile, using the `ProfileExtended` type for type safety.

```ts
import { ProfileExtended } from "node-zugferd/profile/extended";

const data: ProfileExtended = {
  number: "INV-001",
  // ...
};
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create Invoice

Use the previously created instance (`invoicer`) to generate the invoice from your data. You can either:

- Generate standalone XML
- Embed the XML inside a PDF/A-3b compliant file.

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import { invoicer } from "./invoicer";

const invoice = invoicer.create(data);

// Only generate xml
const xml = await invoice.toXML();

// Or embed xml in a PDF-A/3b
const pdf = fs.readFileSync("./your/invoice.pdf");
const pdfA = await invoicer.embedInPdf(pdf); // [!code highlight]
```

</Step>

<Step>
### ðŸŽ‰ That's it [#thats-it]

Your invoice is now ready! You've successfully created a ZUGFeRD invoice using the Extended profile.
