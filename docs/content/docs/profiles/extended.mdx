This profile constitutes an extension of [EN16931 (Comfort)](/docs/profiles/en16931)
aimed at supporting complex business processes (i.e. invoices which are being invoiced across
multiple deliveries or delivery locations, structured terms of payment, further details at item level to
facilitate warehousing etc.), and any business case inventoried in France (gathered in a subset named
EXTENDED B2B FR and its subset EXTENDED-CTC-FR, as referenced by the French Tax Administration
and National Platform PPF â€“ Portail Public de Facturation). This includes additional code lists values
which are not part of the [European Norm EN 16931 code lists](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/Registry+of+supporting+artefacts+to+implement+EN16931).
