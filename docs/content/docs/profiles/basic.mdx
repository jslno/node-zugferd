title: Basic
description: Includes BASIC WL with line-level details and EN 16931 compliance.
---

import { BASIC } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic";

This profile includes [BASIC WL](/docs/profiles/basic-wl) with some details at line level. It is a subset
of EN 16931, which contains all mandatory fields including those on which business rules from the
EN 16931 may apply. It is a compliant CIUS (Core Invoice Usage Specification), which means that all
business rules of the EN 16931 apply.

```ts
import { BASIC, type ProfileBasic } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic";
```

## Basic Usage

<Steps>

<Step>
### Setup the Profile

First configure the zugferd instance (`invoicer`) to use the Basic profile.
This defines the standard and complexity level of the invoice.

```ts title="invoicer.ts"
import { BASIC } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic"; // [!code highlight]

export const invoicer = zugferd({
  profile: BASIC, // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Define Invoice Data

Now define the actual invoice content, including all required fields of the
profile, using the `ProfileBasic` type for type safety.

```ts
import { ProfileBasic } from "node-zugferd/profile/basic";

const data: ProfileBasic = {
  number: "INV-001",
  // ...
};
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create Invoice

Use the previously created instance (`invoicer`) to generate the invoice from your data. You can either:

- Generate standalone XML
- Embed the XML inside a PDF/A-3b compliant file.

```ts
import fs from "fs";
import { invoicer } from "./invoicer";

const invoice = invoicer.create(data);

// Only generate xml
const xml = await invoice.toXML();

// Or embed xml in a PDF-A/3b
const pdf = fs.readFileSync("./your/invoice.pdf");
const pdfA = await invoicer.embedInPdf(pdf); // [!code highlight]
```

</Step>

<Step>
### ðŸŽ‰ That's it [#thats-it]

Your invoice is now ready! You've successfully created a ZUGFeRD invoice using the Basic profile.
